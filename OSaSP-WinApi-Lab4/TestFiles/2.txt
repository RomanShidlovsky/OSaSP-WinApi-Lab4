We didn’t always live in Maple Street. We moved into the house 2 years ago. Before that we lived in Peach Street and before that we lived in Green Street. And before that I can’t remember.

The house in Maple Street was ours and we were happy because we didn’t have to pay rent or share the yard with other people, or be careful not to make too much noise.

It was a small brick house with small windows that looked onto the green back yard. There was no front yard, only four little maples separated the house from the street.

The house didn’t have any modern conveniences except gas. There was no electricity, so we had to light candles when it was dark. There was no running water, so we had to take water from the pipe in the next street. There was no central heating so we had to put on warm clothes when it was cold.

But we liked the house because it was ours and we wouldn’t have to move anymore.
